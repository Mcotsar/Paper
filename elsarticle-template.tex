\section{Introduction}

Material culture variability allows to understand a part of the mechanism of the human behaviour \citep{richerson2005not, schillinger_copying_2016}. Dynamic of changes on the material culture have been analized by the study of cultural pattern which varying over time and space \citep{eerkens_jelmer_cultural_2007, lycett_cultural_2015}. The detection of those  different patterns in artefact production in the archaeological records could also explain whether these change are produced by cultural reasons or not based on economical, political and social changes \citep{basalla1988evolution}. As result, different information are shared by social learning generating an accumulation of knowledges which are transmitted from generation to generations in different context and content conditions  \citep{eerkens_jelmer_cultural_2005, neff1992ceramics,henrich_evolution_2003, boyd_cultural_2011}. Likewise, the mode of learning transmission, along with several external conditions might affect directly or indirectly the pattern of manufacturing of the artefacts. 

%\xavi{Este es el tema principal del paper; deberia ser explicitado antes y un poco mas detallado: 1. queremos entender los procesos productivos del imperio romano, 2. en concreto, la produccion en masa de anforas, 3. la aplicacion de un framework evolutivo nos permitira identificar que tipo de social learning esta envuelto.}

This paper explores the changes in the production processes during the Roman Empire. In particular, our study is focused on understanding the pottery-making techniques by analyzing large-scale amphorae production in a specific area. 

%características de la producción en masa

In this case, an evolutionary framework is used for studying the implication and the impact that this production might involve on the  evolution of social learning processes.  Within evolutionary perspective, social learning is analyzed to understand the human behaviour in archaeology. Thought material culture, we can observe cultural patterns which can explain how the culture evolve \citep{richerson2005not}. Specifically, the aim of this study is understanding how the amphorae production were organized and whether it is possible to identify amphorae made in different workshops. Our main hypothesis concerns about understanding if pottery-making techniques were transmitted through vertical or horizontal social learning and how those knowledges could have been transmitted in time and space. 

Following a large number of authors \citep{cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981, hosfield_modes_2009}. Pottery production can be learned on different modes of cultural transmission depending on the level of production in the communities. Vertical transmission is a mode of transmission when the teaching of the production is done from master to disciple  while in horizontal transmission the workers teach pottery techniques to others workers at the same level and those workers spread the knowledges to their community.

In material culture, artefact variation might be affected by geographical distance \citep{bjorklund_effect_2010,shennan_isolation-by-distance_2015, van_strien_isolation-by-distance_2015} where material culture is more similar in close population who interacted each other. In other case, the correlation between both seems not visible due to different factors \citep{hart_effects_2012}. 



%Specifically, the aim of this study is understanding if pottery-making techniques were transmitted through vertical or horizontal social learning. Our main hypothesis concerns the transmission of the techniques by vertical transmission and how vertical transmission is spreading in time and space. These technological knowledges could have been transmitted from master to disciple and thus continuously. If vertical transmission predominates in this process over horizontal transmission then amphorae made in nearby workshops might share more similar traits than amphorae made from farthest workshop. Otherwise whether horizontal transmission is the main transmission in this process the social learning would be transmitted by workers. Then there would not be differences among workshops on the production. The artefact variation can be related to the geographical distance \citep{bjorklund_effect_2010,shennan_isolation-by-distance_2015, van_strien_isolation-by-distance_2015}. In material culture, artefact variation might be affected by geographical distance where material culture is more similar in close population who interacted each other. In other case, the correlation between both seems not visible due to different factors \citep{hart_effects_2012}. In our case, we can detect measurable differences among this type of amphorae correlated with the geographical distance.


However, different debates revolve around how individuals or groups acquired and transmitted techniques skills  \citep{bowser_learning_2008, mesoudi_cultural_2008}. In addition, this challenge is combined with the difficulty detecting the different modes of transmission in the archaeological record \citep{roux_standardization_2015}. In the case of archaeology, several studies have analysed this process focused on the production of handmade pottery \citep{steele_james_ceramic_2010} or stylistic variations \citep{neiman_stylistic_1995, shennan_ceramic_2001}. Specifically our work pretend to know if those processes could be similar with a more standardized and massive production \citep{gandon_copying_2014}, focused on the case of pottery production in the Roman Empire. In this work we have explored the social learning processes associated with amphorae production through a combination of empirical analysis and multivariate methods
                     
The paper can be sketched as follows. The next section introduces the case study and existing hypotheses, the third section will illustrate about the methods that we have applied to analyze our case study, the next section will deal about the results; and finally we highlight with a discussion about our results.  


\section{The amphoric production in Roman Baetica}

Our case study examines the variation of the amphorae production located in \emph{Baetica} (currently Andalusia, south Spain). During the Roman Empire, a large-scale infrastructure of amphorae production was developed around this area to supply the provinces of the Roman Empire with a huge impact during the supplying of the roman legions in places such as Britania \citep{funari_economic_2005, monfort_britannia_1998} or Germania \citep{remesal_annona_1986}. For this reason, this ancient province became an important support for the production and distribution of olive oil to the rest of the Empire from Ist to IIIrd centuries \cite{chic_comercio_2005,millet_anforas_1998, rodriguez_baetican_1998}. \emph{Baetica} had also a strong connection thought rivers that allowed developing an important trade network mostly around the Mediterranean \citep{garcia_vargas_enrique_formal_2010}. As result of this increase, more than 90 pottery workshops were currently located along the Guadalquivir river and its tributaries. The majority of amphorae produced in this area belong to \emph{Dressel 20} divided into different typologies \citep{berni_millet_epigrafianforica_2008, martin-kilcher_romischen_1994}. This amphora type was used mostly to transport olive oil for around 300 years in order to satisfy the demand within Roman Empire \citep{rodriguez_economioleicola_1977}. In particular, olive oil was a significant product frequently related in different aspect of the roman daily life such as consumption, lighting and hygiene \citep{mattingly_d.j._oil_1988}. 
%%add una cita m\'as Peacock

The importance of this commerce is also showed by the fact that Dressel 20 amphorae production were identified with different marks about its provenance although the meaning of the actors in this process seems not clear \citep{coto-sarmiento_maria_bayesian_????}. Thus, this amphorae production was a particular example of production strategy that experimented few changes around three centuries. In any case, our main question will be related to understand how the amphorae workshops were organized in \textit{Baetica} area and the transmission of the production techniques by potters. Thereby, technological knowledge could have been transmitted by vertical transmission where technical knowledges is learned to master to apprentice and thus continuously. If vertical transmission predominates in this process over horizontal transmission then amphorae made in nearby workshops might share more similar traits than amphorae made from farthest workshop. Otherwise whether horizontal transmission is the main transmission in this process the social learning would be transmitted by workers. Then there would not be differences among workshops on the production. In our case, we can detect measurable differences among this type of amphorae correlated with the geographical distance.


\section{Material and methods}

We analyse a dataset of 470 amphorae collected from 5 different workshops excavated. The workshops were located in Malpica (Palma del R\'io, C\'ordoba), Cerro del Bel\'en (Palma del R\'io, C\'ordoba) \citep{diaz_trujillo_excavacion_1992}, Parlamento (Sevilla) \citep{garcia_vargas_anforas_2000}, Villaseca (C\'ordoba)\citep{garcia_vargas_enrique_excavacion_????} and Las Delicias (\'Ecija, Sevilla) \citep{fernandez_excavacion_2001,_atelier_2014} \ref{romanworkshop}. 


\begin{figure}[htp]
	\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{romanworkshop.png}
\caption{Dressel 20 workshops were mostly distributed along the rivers Gualdalquivir and Genil. Location of the five workshops analyzed in this area.}
\label{romanworkshop}
\end{figure} 


We created a dataset where were selected 80-100 samples of each pottery workshops. The choice of these workshops corresponded to several reasons. Firstly, the workshops were selected from different spaces in order to analyse the production patterns depending on the distance of each workshop. Secondly, the extended chronology of these workshops serves as proxy to examine changes on the variation shape. In our case, the type Dressel 20 did not experimented especially visible changes on the production pattern during three centuries.%citar berni? 
Finally, the workshops selected were open excavated and provided a large number of materials.   

Eight different measurements were taken for each amphorae sample of the 5 workshops studied. The measurements were done using different tools: caliber, square and bevel to take the measurements and profile gauge to draw the pottery shapes. 

The measurements were focused on the rim sherds whose fragments were the most preserved on the archaeological sample. In the case of pottery attributes, rim sherds and the curvature of handles work as an useful indicators of variability \citep{berni_millet_epigrafianforica_2008}. \maria{especificado en la pagina 25, explain why}
Moreover, the measurements were divided into exterior diameter, inside diameter, rim height, rim width, shape width, rim inside height, other rim width and protruding rim \ref{mesures}. The method requires a large sample size and for this reason we focused on rim sherds. Other significant parts such as handles and bases are found in lesser quantities thus compromising the applicability of the method due to small sample size.

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{mesures.png}
\caption{Example of the 8 measurements taken for the sample in order to provide morphometric data}
\label{mesures}
\end{figure} 

In our study, we have selected five variants according with three centuries
(Dressel B: I; Dressel C: I-II; Dressel D: II; Dressel E: III, Dressel F: III. Without important variations in three centuries, the chronology respond to a relative dating obtained by the classification identified on shapes in different studies defined by defined by P. Berni \citep{berni_millet_epigrafianforica_2008} and Martin Kilcher \citep{martin-kilcher_romischen_1994}. All of these variants selected were found in excavations from the proper workshops studied in order to avoid some material which can contaminate the sample. For the proposal of this study, the rest of variants were not taken into account from our study by not having enough material for the analysis. 


\subsection{Principal Component Analysis}

The sample selected were tested using statistical method such as Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Analysis to explore these metrical differences on the rim sherds. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to find patterns in our dataset. This method allows to create a reduced number of \textit{new variables} which contain all the relevant information of the previous variables without losing relevance. The firsts principal components are expressed as the result of the most variance of the all information from the original variables. Moreover the information is expressed as the result of most variation retained in the first principal components \citep{jolliffe_principal_2002, shennan_quantifying_1997}. This method is commonly used in archaeology for the study of the variation of material culture \citep{li_crossbows_2014, schillinger_differences_2016}. In our study, this method allows to transform our measurements into PCs and take the firsts PCA with more variability in the dataset.  


\subsection{Discriminant Linear Analysis} 


The performed results with PCA were analysed with Lineal Discriminant Analyse (LDA). LDA was used to find significant differences among workshops by the combination among variables obtained for the first principal components. LDA identifies which variables allow to distinguish or discriminate each group and how many variables are necessary to achieve the best combination as possible. In our case, this method allowed to demonstrate the correlation between spatial distance and distance among workshops. LDA was used to explore a better separate training set from the results of the most relevant principal components. LDA can classify the PCs result of the measurements into different groups.  We also generate a Confusion Matrix (CM) to able of quantifying the degree of confusion and compare the index of similarity among workshops.  CM calculated the probability of success and error of the results. It generates a matrix where higher value are the results of an incorrect classification. The distance generated with the results of DA will be compared with the spatial distance to see if it exists a correlation between morphometric distance and spatial distance. As example, this method has been commonly used to detect differences in artifact production \citep{charlton_investigating_2012, thorpe_distribution_1984}, and particularly for a similar study about the production pottery in \emph{Tarraconense} \citep{i_martin_alisis_1998}



\section{Results}

Several multivariate methods such as PCA and LDA were used to quantify the technical differences on the pattern production among workshops. The analysis of PCA produces a set of values for each variable observed. Variables show how much variability exist in the dataset grouped by each principal components. The results, indicated in the Fig \ref{pcaresults}, show a huge variability in the first principal component than the rest.
The most differences were focused on the protruding rim and rim width.

The patterns observed in the first 2 Principal Components were plotted to visualize the degree of variation by isolation among workshops. The results, shown in Fig. \ref{pca}, suggested than amphorae from closer workshops tend to be more similar than amphorae made in furthest workshops. In particular, the Fig illustrates how the four closest workshops show variation on PC1 (i.e. Bel\'en, Delicias, Villaseca and Malpica) while Parlamento displays a distinctive pattern than the rest of workshops on PC2 values.

Discriminant Analysis was used to analyze the results obtained from PCA. The results of CM showed than workshops with more troubles to be distinguished such Malpica and Bel\'en shared a minor spatial distance than the rest (see Table~\ref{table:confusion}). Therefore, similar amphorae making techniques processes were strongly correlated with the spatial distance.

We compared morphometric and spatial distance by performing peer-to-peer analysis between all workshops. We calculated the geographical distance between each site and the distance among pottery measures, calculated using the previous results.

Thus, the results suggest a variability on the making-techniques processes might depend on the spatial distance.  

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}


Differences on the making techniques processes among workshops show a variability correlated with spatial distance. The analysed morphometric traits suggest that the similarity between amphorae decrease with the spatial distance between the workshops where they were produced. As result, amphorae made in nearby workshops with a minor spatial distance share more traits than amphorae made in pottery workshops furthest. In other words, the variability on the making techniques processes between closer workshops was difficult to differentiate. In our case, Malpica and Bel\'en workshops where the geographical proximity are the closest shared more traits in comparison with other workshops (Parlamento and Las Delicias). Thus the probability of interaction between workshops is increasing when the proximity is closest while this likelihood decreases when the possibility of interaction is low. 

We have observed than rivers courses could have affected in the transmission factors. In the case of the commerce, rivers and its tributaries played an important role for the transport of goods. The huge demand within Roman Empire and the good conditions for the loading and unloading of products \maria {busqueda citation needed} might have influenced the mode of transmission due to the continuous contact between workshops. 

The results suggest also that vertical transmission could be the main cultural mechanism to explain the variability between workshops. The different morphological traits among workshops seem proper of a low contact between potters from others workshops. The evidenced confirms therefore that these techniques traits were transmitted with high fidelity and only with few changes during three centuries. It would mean that the disciples could have remained the making techniques processes in the workshops where they were trained.  

By contrast, horizontal transmission doesn't seem to be the most probable process. The continuous contact between potters from different places had generated a more homogeneity in the technical practises. Workshops were sharing the same production techniques. As result, it would generate a social network where potters with the same social learning level worked in different workshops at the same time. Our result suggest a progressive contact with closer workshop instead. Moreover, the fact that isolation by distance is detected suggests a limited displacement between distant workshops. Thus, vertical transmission would be explained with this observed process. However, the diversity of social learning processes are clearly complex. In other words, the transmission of knowledges between master and disciple did not discard that horizontal transmission played an important role in this process as well. It can be a process where this vertical transmission dominated at first in the same workshops but consequently this transmission would be affected by workers who exchanged ideas or workers moving to other workshops.  

%podría ser conclusión
The combination of empirical analysis with the statistical methods have provided a strong baseline for a better understanding of the amphorae production in the Roman Empire. These methods offer also an strong complement to other methods as archaeometry for the characterization of production sites and places of consumption.  

We have identified measurable differences in the techniques by observing and we have tested these particularities using multivariate methods. Our analysis provides an useful baseline for the exploration of the social learning processes related with amphora production in the Roman Empire. Hence, the results have lightened to understand the link between social learning and archaeological evidence in a diversity of scenarios.
