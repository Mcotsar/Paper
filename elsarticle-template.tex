\section{Introduction}

\section{Background}

\subsection{Study area}

Our principal case study examines the variation of the amphorae production located in \emph{Baetica} (currently Andalusia, south Spain). During the Roman Empire, this ancient province became an important support for the production and distribution of  olive oil to the rest of the Empire from Ist to IIIrd centuries (Remesal). 
For this reason, a large-scale infrastructure of amphorae production was developed around this area to supply the provinces of the Roman Empire with an important impact during military campaigns (remesal concierto, monfort, temin y kessler).

\emph{Baetica} had also a strong connection thought rivers which allowed developing an important trade network around the Mediterranean (Remesal, Vargas). More than 80 pottery workshops were currently located along the Guadalquivir river and its tributaries (citar Berni, Remesalin and Enriquito)(Fig).However all the sites examined have currently experimented multiples geographic transformations due to the anthropic action and the dynamic of the rivers (Enrique y Remesal). 

The majority of amphorae identified in this area belong to \emph{Dressel 20} typology divided into different sub-typologies (Martin-Kilcher, Berni bibliografia). This amphora type was used mostly to transport olive oil for around 300 years in order to satisfy the high demand within Roman Empire (Remesal ingles). In particular, olive oil was a significant product frequently related in different aspect of the roman daily life such as consumption, lighting and hygiene (Temin?)

The demand is also showed by the fact that amphorae Dressel 20 were identified with several marks about its provenance (remesal and xavi). However, the meaning of the stamps seems not clear: it could be an agent identified as a olive oil producer or an agent identified as a potter factory. In any case, this paper will be only focused on the study of evolution of the amphorae (Rubio, Remesal sellos). 

\section{Material and methods}

We analyse a dataset of 470 amphorae collected from 5 different workshops excavated. 
The workshops were located in Malpica (Palma del R\'io, C\'ordoba), Cerro del Bel\'en (Palma del R\'io, C\'ordoba), Parlamento (Sevilla), Villaseca (C\'ordoba) and Las Delicias (\'Ecija, Sevilla). We created a dataset where were selected 80-100 samples of each pottery workshops. The choice of these workshops corresponded to several reasons. Firstly, the workshops were selected from different spaces in order to analyse the production patterns depending on the distance of each workshop. Secondly, the extended chronology of these workshops serves as proxy to examine changes on the variation shape. Finally, the workshops selected were open excavated and provided a large number of materials.   

%(hablar de que no han cambiado en tres siglos??)


\subsection{Field methods}


Eight different measurements were taken for each amphorae sample of the 5 workshops studied. The measurements were done by one person using different tools: caliber, square and bevel for taking the measurements and profile gauge for drawing the pottery shapes. 

The measurements were focused on the rim sherds whose fragments were the most preserved on the archaeological sample. In the case of pottery attributes, rim sherd works as an useful indicator of variability (poner bibliografía berni? ). Moreover, the measurements were divided into exterior diameter, inside diameter, rim height, rim width, shape width, rim inside height, rim width and protruding rim (Fig). We excluded other measurements such as handles and bases from our study due to the lack of these in the sample.    

In our study, we have only selected five variants according with three centuries (Dressel B: I; Dressel C: I-II; Dressel D: II; Dressel E: III, Dressel F: III) defined by P. Berni (bibliografía de Berni) and Martin Kilcher (Martin Kilcher). The rest of variants were not taken into account from our analysis by not having enough material for the sample. 

Finally, the sample selected were tested using statistical method such as Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Analysis to explore these metrical differences.

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis}

%%PCA (podría poner biblio de Shennan y el de Jollife (2002) de Principal Component Analysis)

We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify a large number of variables into a smaller number of variables. This method allows to create a reduced number of \textit{new variables} which contain all the relevant information of the previous variables without losing relevance. The firsts principal components are expressed as the result of the most variance of the all information from the original variables.  
The information is expressed as the result of most variation retained in the first principal components. (Jollife, 2002)
In our study, this method allowed us to reduce our dataset of 8 measurements as variables into 2 variables.

\subsection{Discriminant Linear Analysis} 


The performed results with PCA were analysed with Lineal Discriminant Analyse (LDA). LDA was used to find significant differences among workshops by the combination among variables obtained for the first principal components. In spite of being similar to PCA, LDA identifies which variables allow to distinguish or discriminate each group and how many variables are necessary to achieve the best combination as possible. In our case, LDA was used to explore a better separate training set from the results of the most relevant principal components. 

Data were collected and performed in LibreOffice 4.2.8.2 and analysed in R version 3.2.4. statistical language and implemented with the package MASS. 


\section{Results}

Several multivariate methods such as PCA and DLA were used to quantify the technical differences on the pattern production among workshops. 5 workshops were chosen  following criteria described above.

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis}

The analysis of PCA produces a set of values for each variable observed. Variables show how much variability exist in the dataset grouped by each principal components. The results, indicated in the Table, show most variability in the firsts principal components than the rest (mostrar el que más con el analisis).The most differences were focused on the (poner donde más estuvieron enfocadas)

The patterns observed in the first 2 Principal Components were plotted to visualize the degree of variation by isolation among workshops. The results, shown in Fig., suggested than amphorae from closer workshops tend to be more similar than amphorae made in furthest workshops. In particular, the Fig illustrates how the four closest workshops show variation on PC1 (i.e. Belén, Delicias, Villaseca and Malpica) while Parlamento displays a distinctive pattern than the rest of workshops on PC2 values. 


\subsection{Discriminant Analysis}

%Tengo que decir que uso principales componentes antes que analisis discriminante para hacer un trainning 

Discriminant Analysis was used to perform the results of the PCA. We generate a Confusion Matrix (CM) to quantify the degree of confusion among workshops. CM calculated the probability of success and error of the results. It generates a matrix where higher value are the results of an incorrect classification. 





The results of Confusion Matrix showed than workshops with more troubles to be distinguished such Malpica and Bel\'en shared a minor spatial distance than the rest (see Fig). Therefore, in our study, similar amphorae making techniques processes are strongly correlated with the spatial distance. 

\subsection{Spatial Analysis}

We compared morphometric and spatial distance by performing peer-to-peer analysis between all workshops. We calculated the geographical distance between each site and the distance among pottery measures, calculated using the previous results. (FIG) shows that the pottery distance is correlated with the spatial distance of workshops.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

Differences on the making techniques processes among workshops were identified using empirical methods and  multivariate analysis. The results show the variability could be affected by the distance. The analysed morphometric traits suggest that the similarity between amphorae decrease with the spatial distance between the workshops they were produced. As result (in other words), amphorae made in nearby workshops with a minor spatial distance share more traits than amphorae made in pottery workshops furthest. In other words, the variability between closer workshops, such as Malpica and Bel\'en workshops, were difficult to differentiate in our results.  

The combination of empirical analysis with the statistic confirm that vertical transmission could be the main cultural mechanism to explain the variability between workshops. By contrast, horizontal transmission doesn't seems to be the most probable process (no parece ser el principal proceso pero no lo descartamos que no haya influenciado) although we don't discard its important role in this process (meter remesal con los discipulos)

The evidenced confirms that pottery techniques were learned from master to disciple by social learning. The disciples could have remained the making techniques processes in the workshop where they were trained. (explicar un poco y explicar por trabajadores del mismo nivel workers by the same level)


Isolation by distance is supported with our results.
